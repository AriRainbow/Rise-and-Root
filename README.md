## üìå About the Project

The **Rise & Root Collective** website is the official online home of our inclusive, nature-based nonprofit organization. This project was developed as part of a web development course, but its purpose extends far beyond the classroom.

Our goal was to create a living, breathing platform that reflects the heart of Rise & Root Collective: empowering youth of all backgrounds through free access to educational, outdoor, and community-centered programming.

This initial site serves as both an introduction and a foundation. It showcases our mission, values, and offerings, while paving the way for future growth ‚Äî from interactive educational resources to year-round programming.

Built with **accessibility**, **responsiveness**, and **clarity** in mind, this website invites visitors to explore, get involved, and grow with us.
